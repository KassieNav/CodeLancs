    <h5>I'm an enthusiastic digital developer looking for work.</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>In one of my projects, we had to do a windows refresh. That means pick up current laptops and replace them with new ones.<Br>
        The challenge was gearing everyone up to speed so that no one is unable to work for any periods of time.<br>
    We then put up a system in place where when a staff comes to pick up their laptop, they go into a face to face training session.<br>
Then we set up drop in sessions for anyone who needs a refresher months later. This allowed a seemless desktop refresh to take place.</li><br>
        <li>I work in a department full of older men. A couple of years back, I found it quite hard to get colleagues to give my idea a chance.<br>
            Because of my age, and sometimes gender, I often used to feel undermined.<br>
        After many frustrating attempts to be heard, I thought I'd use my God given empathy to softten them up. I took time to get to know my colleagues. I offered help<br>
    when they are in need and just tried to change the culture at work. Now, I have a pleasant relationship with my work colleagues where there's mutual respect for <br>
each other.</bt> </li><br>
        <li>I really wanted to be a pop star but couldn't seem to make it in the industry. I tried various mediums, like youtube, tik tok.<br>
        But in the shower one day, I got hit with the realisation that I'm already a star. So I overcame my unbelief.<br>
    Now I have daily shows in the bathroom. :)</li>
